You can learn more about Open Policy Agent (OPA) on their [official documentation](link)

Here's a quick terminology on all things associated with inspektor.

**OPA:** The Open Policy Agent (OPA, pronounced “oh-pa”) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. 

You can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.

**rego:** Rego (pronounced "ray-go") is a high-level declarative query language, inspired by Datalog. It is used by OPA (Open Policy Agent) to define policies that are easy to read, write and understand, which means that you can state what your queries should return instead of describing how to do it.


**ControlPlane:** The control plane is the part of a network that controls how data packets are forwarded — meaning how data is sent from one place to another. The process of creating a routing table, for example, is considered part of the control plane. 

Routers use various protocols to identify network paths, and they store these paths in routing tables.


**DataPlane:** In contrast to the control plane, which determines how packets should be forwarded, the data plane actually forwards the packets. The data plane is also called the forwarding plane.

Think of the control plane as being like the stoplights that operate at the intersections of a city. Meanwhile, the data plane (or the forwarding plane) is more like the cars that drive on the roads, stop at the intersections, and obey the stoplights.

**psql:** psql is a terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL. It enables you to type in queries interactively, issue them to PostgreSQL, and see the query results. Alternatively, input can be from a file or from command line arguments.


**beekeeper:** pen Source SQL Editor and Database Manager. A modern, easy to use, and good looking SQL client for MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, SQL Server, and more.

**Postgres:** PostgreSQL also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance.

**Docker:** Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.

**Docker Compose:** Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, can spin everything up or tear it all down.

**Containerization:**  Containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes make it very easy to spin up new services and scale them on-demand.

**Service:** A component of an Application. Multiple instances of a Service are typically deployed for high availability and scalability. A Service may be deployed in multiple locations.

**Microservices:** Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams. Compared to monoliths, microservices-based applications are riskier.
